          They all sit and smile, the corners of their mouths curving upwards in a most unnatural way.<br>
          Their heads fall back as they laugh their hearts out, their chests vibrating with each laugh.<br>
          I am unique in my sadness and so while my lips form a firm line and my eyes are glossed over <br>with impending tears,
          their eyes are squeezed upwards as their cries of joy escape their lips.<br>
          They look through me as though I am glass and they continue in their bliss, my sorrow oblivious to them.<br>

          I force a smile and try to join them in their joy, but the smile that adorns me is unreal and I fail.

        Seeing you<br>
        You say "how are you?"<br>
        I'm confused<br>
        Should I tell you I had to finish an assignment<br> and stayed up too late?<br>
        Should I tell you I didn't sleep well?<br>
        Should I tell you I missed my alarm?<br>
        Should I tell you about the upcoming essay<br>
        The chemistry project<br>
        The religion case study<br>
        Finals?<br>
        The fear before each of them<br>
        not being able to sleep, to relax or how you just can't catch your breath?<br>
        Should I tell you about the news<br>
        I saw this morning<br>
        How many people died<br>
        Due to some autocrat thinking they could do whatever they want to?<br>
        How sorry I feel but can't change anything?<br>
        Should I tell you about friends I miss?<br>
        Should I tell you about all my problems?<br>
        Should I tell you how lost I'm feeling in this universe?<br>
        I just say, "Good.<br>
        How are you?"

      <div class="toggle-content">
        The world is very round!<br>
It's like a ball—round and sphere.<br>
What comes around,<br>
goes around.<br>
Together we make greatness in this world,<br>
but selfishness takes our hard work away.<br>
The world is beautiful, like a bundle of roses,<br>
but is harsh, like concrete.<br><br>

The world is small, like a bouncy ball.<br>
Help someone out today,<br>
because always remember,<br>
what you put in is what you get out—<br>
since the world is very round.

      <button class="toggle-btn">A Bite of Nostalgia – Hana He ’27</button>
      <div class="toggle-content" id="a-bite-of-nostalgia">Waking up, I hear soft muffles of conversation while a thin ray of light peek in the cracks of the door. The calendar marks February 10th, Korean New Year. I rub my eyes while walking out my room only to be jolted awake by a heavenly scent of unami. In the kitchen is an amorphous figure of steam that accompanies my mom as she stirs the pot. Chop. Chop. Chop. My footsteps sync the rhythm of my mom’s knife dancing on the cutting board. “Here’s your tteok-guk!” My mom exclaims. I respond, “      잘 먹겠습니다!           

        ” Warm steam hits my face before I see my bowl, and so does a pang of nostalgia. Tteok-guk is a traditional Korean dish that consists of a beef broth with thinly sliced, oval rice cakes. The rice cakes come to life with the garnish of thin, rectangular pieces of seaweed, egg, meat, and zucchini. Reminiscing the richness of the broth and chewiness of the rice cakes, I swiftly put a spoonful in my mouth. However, instead of delectable notes of unami, a burning sensation strikes my tongue. It’s too hot! I feel the heat electrocute my taste buds. My hands grab my glass of water swiftly, and the cool liquid soothes my throat. Meanwhile, my sister had woken up and had started eating her tteok-guk. We eat in silence for a while, until she asks, “How old did you get?” “20, you?” I replied. It is said that consuming tteok-guk on Korean New Year increases your age; my sister and I joke that you gain an age with every rice cake you eat. I lift my spoon from my bowl for another bite, but I realize it is my last. Every year, I eat this rice cake soup, and this will mark another bowl, another year of my life. I swallow carefully.</div>

      <div class="toggle-content" id="an-alluring-world">What if the world wasn't being held down by humans<br>
        Sprouting from the ground with glistening baby pinks and
        pure whites branching from the roots embedded in the soil<br>
        Green forests encompassed with trees shining with light 
        versus being coated with smoke covers<br>
        Glorious animals climbing, walking, and transcending the 
        land they no longer are shielded from<br>
        Air flowing freely while whistling its tune<br>
        The greens of Mother Nature stretching to release oxygen<br>
        No longer swamped in the hand grasp of pollutions 
        looming shadow<br>
        Blue crystal tides not speckled with greens from man's
        synthetics<br>
        Human glories wiping smiles off the majestic creatures
        from the poles white relics<br>
        The shrieking silence of UV light cutting through the
        ozone knight of the atmosphere<br>
        A world slowly crumbling, while being continuously
        clogged with bodies, within the stratosphere<br>
        If only, these possibilities weren't above the glass ceiling of
        humankind.</div>

      <button class="toggle-btn">Chaos is a Ladder – Elvis He ’27</button>
      <div class="toggle-content">We are afraid of chaos because of the violence, ferocity, evilness,<br>
        Like a bottomless abyss, deep and dark.<br>
        But pure chaos is a ladder rather than a pit.<br>
        The ladder of chaos is random but fair.<br>
        It is a game of risk, an irresistible storm,<br>
        Deadly, orderless, but tempting.<br>
        The game is an offer for the valors, none shall refuse,<br>
        It is the lure of fatal benefits that can't be resisted.<br>
        The beauty of chaos is a thorny rose,<br>
        lying in the uncertainties, waiting to be "throned".<br>
        Oh, look! The cowards refused to climb!<br>
        What a pity! It is the treasure that they shall never find!<br>
        Oh, look! Another one fell from the ladder!<br>
        Unfortunate! The fall breaks the spirit and courage to climb!<br>
        But a champion there shall always be,<br>
        The climb is all there is.</div>

      <button class="toggle-btn">A Glimpse of Serenity – Cindy Han ’27</button>
      <div class="toggle-content">    The memory settled in my mind like a tiny yellow stone, from the year before COVID-19, till now. The view outside of the car window flashed by. In a blur, we arrived at a huge cabin in Yellowstone. The sky was so clear that I was almost able to fish the moon from the watery, mirror-like grounds. That night was so peaceful. In the warmth of the campfire, we enjoyed our long-awaited barbecue. Tiny sparks of campfire twinkled and up they went. With a tiny soft strike, it stayed up with thousands of stars. The wind that danced over our faces was refreshing, filling our lungs with the delicious smell of burning wood and food. In the distance, there were no clouds, all we could see was the shining of immensity. My friends and I shared the sense of relaxation and calmness with each other lying on the grass, opening our minds toward the sparkling night sky. 

<br><br>    With the rustling leaves and singing birds, the sun peeked over the horizon and climbed up the branches of trees, guiding us through the park. When I was young, my most cherished memory of Yellowstone was buried in the Hot Springs Park, which has always been my favorite, still impressive after all those years. The springs were magnificent, as though surrounded by colorful ribbons, every drop of air was a different color. The world was in a shower of colorful mist. As we walked through the springs with gases surrounding us, the bad smell of sulfur ran into our faces, like rotten eggs. When we were little, we used to call it the “farting spring", beside which we could hardly survive. Under the clear crystal sky, there were the clear bubbling springs and us. 

<br><br>      As we drove back that day, trees were waving at us, everything swirling like in waves. Our eyes were all wide open with surprise. A tiny tornado appeared in front of us, just in our eyesight. It moved away from us into the trees. We chased it, as though a friend who we hadn’t met for a long time. Sadly, it disappeared, but like a Patronus, it left us at a miraculous river site. As I walked near it, the mild running water gave me strength. I held a handful of clear water, and let it run down from my palms. It glittered in the beam of sunlight, like crystal. We love the bubbling of the tiny ripples and the rustling of leaves. Little deer glanced at us at the side of a hill, as they'd been waiting there for a long time. 

<br><br>     I whispered in my friend’s ears, “Did you see that, how big and amazing the world is?” 
<br><br>     She whispered back, astoundingly, “Yeah, I did...” “I’ll always remember this journey, wish it is already woven into  our dream of this midsummer...” 
<br><br> “行虽短，忆却长………”“(Though the journey was short, memory stays...)” 
<br><br>     The world sank down into our eyes, the journey, the memories, settled in our minds, as though it’s all a dream...

        Like my computer, glitching.<br>
        Dang it, I forgot to pay.<br>
        Once again, my brain was at play.<br>
        Distractions are bewitching.<br>
        What did you say?<br>
        I was writing a poem in my head;<br>
        Hearing, but not listening to your words.<br>
        Writing my own adjectives and verbs.<br>
        I'm sorry, I should probably go back to bed.<br>

      <button class="toggle-btn">Falling for You is Like Crocheting – July Wen ’25</button>
      <div class="toggle-content">Falling for you is like crocheting<br>
        Stitch after stitch<br>
        Strings of yarn woven through me<br>
        Closing my eyes, pulling my heart<br>
        Tangled up with the way<br>
        It beats or stops<br><br>
        Never knew I could be drawn into something<br>
        So blandly repetitive<br>
        Almost meaningless, if I ignore the soreness in my hands<br>
        But I'm an addict for the overwhelming uncertainty<br>
        —will it end up being<br>
        Given up on, some cut and tied up scraps<br>
        Left in a trash can out the door?<br>
        Will I leave the unfinished<br>
        And someday find it in the deepest corner of my closet<br>
        Covered in dust,<br>
        With the same mistaken edges<br>
        And wrongly tied knots?<br>
        Will its remnants remind me of how it aches?<br>
        Will the way the yarn tangles describe<br>
        those sleepless nights and ideas of you?<br>
        And it's this uncertainty that keeps me going<br>
        Stitch after stitch, weaving in anxiety, passion<br>
        And Hope that escapes and returns<br>
        I keep on working the yarn<br>
        Weaving in words I'll never say to you<br>
        Reaching out to the slightest possibility, asking<br>
        Will it become something<br>
        That could one day keep me warm?</div>

        That I sometimes sail across<br>
        Each time I return,<br>
        I return with a holiday home doesn't celebrate<br>
        Each time I return,<br>
        I return further away from you<br>
        I used to share with you dawns,<br>
        meals, and poems<br>
        Now we barely share one city<br>
        and it's barren cold<br>
        You flip through pretend photo albums of my life<br>
        The same way I roll films containing<br>
        Fragmented frames of yours<br>
        All my Hope dissolved, and<br>
        All my what-ifs buried<br>
        I watch our once woven-together lives slowly detangle,<br>
        And I'll forever hold the urge<br>
        During my countless sleepless midnights<br>
        (when in your world there's daylight)<br>
        To ask you:<br>
        The million times I've crossed time zones<br>
        Have I ever crossed your mind?</div>

      <button class="toggle-btn">When The Rain – Zimo Li ’27</button>
      <div class="toggle-content">It was winter, the sun was hanging up in the mist. I opened the rusted gate and went down by the river. It’s freezing cold in mid-noon. The river is barren, dirt of the riverbed was frozen but left with strokes of greens. Wind blows as I walk, numbing my senses like covering me with a piece of translucent cloth. Few people scatter in the park, some strolling, some sitting. I could barely see anyone’s face as they covered themselves with black and white. I evaded my eyesight from them. I felt loneliness like there was an endless void between me and what I could see. <br><br>

        I walked into the shadow of the bridge in front of me, cars flushing above me relentlessly with the sky of dull gray set behind. The noises immersed my ears, thus I could not hear. The sunlight hid behind the bridge. Beams of light barely penetrated through the rusted fences, scattered out before they could reach me. I sat on the bench below the bridge, staring at only patches of color on the riverbed enjoying the only beam of sunlight out of the shadow. They were so close to me, but I preferred to stay. I don’t belong to them.<br><br>
        
         “What are you doing here?”<br><br>
        
         “Oh, I’m—” I stood up suddenly, trying to reply to his words. But he kept walking without a glimpse.<br><br>
        
         I slowly sit down, the roughness of the surface stings my fingers. I felt not embarrassed but relieved.<br><br>
        
         “Get home, kid, it’s about to rain.” He cleared his throat and turned his head to me for a moment while speaking to me.<br><br>
        
         “What?”<br><br>
        
         “Get home!” He shouted. I saw his body shaking. Unlike others, he didn’t cover his face, in fact, his head is barely covered with any piece of cloth, leaving his wrinkles and ears in touch with coldness and sights.<br><br>
        
         I kept myself quiet, gazing at the man. He wore a pure black coat, beautiful even without schemes of color. Although shaking, his elegance leaks from every gap of his coat. He walks with no sound, acts with no imperfection. He is the chaos that absorbs lights that dare to get close. <br><br>
         He walked away, fading out of my sight. I kept sitting, it felt like forever. I glimpsed his back again, though obscure like spots of black, a flash of color was brought to my eyes, sweeping over me, then back to void and darkness. It was a flash of iridescent on my glasses, colored everything that was gray. I felt the roughness again. I’m still sitting on the bench, but the green I stared at no longer shines in my eyes. The man’s gone. He left nothing in my eyes. It was irresistible, I stood up, passed beneath the bridge, walked out of the shadow that covered me. <br><br>

         As he said, with a few raindrops, it started to rain. Everything darkened again, but I kept walking.<br><br>
         
         Maybe it was a dream, but I prefer to sleep; Maybe it was a lie, but I prefer to believe.</div>

        I see scattered dots connecting<br>
        Forming constellations pulsing with emotion<br>
        Heartfelt bonds easily severed by my single shove<br>
        I see a ball precariously balanced in front of the precipice<br>
        Intoxicatingly close to the darkness, <em>my darkness</em><br>
        I can’t help but chuckle: one nudge would suffice<br>
        <br>
        (The cue ball skids<br>
        Across the table<br>
        Inches closer<br>
        Makes impact<br>
        Yet<br>
        The desperate<br>
        Observer of the pit<br>
        Budges, tilts forward<br>
        But does not fall<br>
        A miss.)<br>
        <br>
        And maybe, just maybe<br>
        Even when I’m playing alone<br>
        No matter how much chalk I rub onto the tip of the stick<br>
        —— Victory isn’t always mine to own.</div>

        what does gender dysphoria feel like?<br>

      <button class="toggle-btn">Monsters – Michelle Olak ’24</button>
      <div class="toggle-content">If monsters are as strong as we think, why do they hide themselves under our beds? Why do the monsters in our life stay in the shadows, if they are powerful and dangerous? Maybe the monsters in our minds are only as significant as we make them. Maybe they hide from us because they’re ashamed to be a part of us. We never see our monsters in the light, because we’ve covered them in darkness. These parts of ourselves are filled with so much shame, because we neglect them to fill ourselves with the perception of perfectness. Happiness is a concept stolen by our own demons because it’s sitting on a silver platter ready to be taken from us. The only one to relieve your soul of its doomed eternity is your own subconscious. The power of your own mind can split the line between the seeing and the blind. So as we look back in time, we cannot spite our past because it is a part of our present mind. 

<br><br> We are who we have become and everything it took to get here. We are who we are going to be 25 years from now, so why hate the old versions of ourselves? Why place our tears on shelves and try to escape the inevitable? If you’re ashamed of your past, you’re ashamed of your future. Don’t conflict your mind into thinking about who you want to be, because who you are right now cannot accomplish the near or the far if there are barriers being placed at every given pathway. The world gives an appearance of flawlessness, but the imperfections are so prominent, it is seen as perfect. 

<br><br>The society that works day and night, pays taxes to a government that doesn’t give a damn about whether you live or die. The rich who cannot even speak to the homeless, can’t even bat an eye. The structure was built with the brick of flaws, made to create failure and desire evil intent, made out of everything wrong. The demons inside your body feel everlasting, because you can never be enough living on planet earth. There's always more to be done, more to accomplish, more to become. So we hate ourselves because we think it will help us trive for a better life. But all we’re doing is creating a sequence in a strive for a better life. But all we’re doing is creating a sequence in a world that has restraints on who is black or white. The stupidity that we go through, claiming maturity and soulfulness, will be the death of us all in an essence that values more than a check from your bank. To the children dying from war, while we ignore, looking at the polls deciding who we should or shouldn’t rank. These same politicians sell children while claiming the land of the free, taking advantage of their demons' opportunities, as we all do nothing to stop this foolishness. 
<br><br>Our monsters don’t hide under our beds, they live inside of our heads. So why fear the darkness if that is who we are? The lurking of evil in this world is so surreal, you’d think you have to die to make it far. We drive a car, we crash, we die, another number in the system, a dead body in the soil, a forgotten soul. Who the fuck cares about us at all? Don’t fear who you are, because one day you’ll need your monsters.</nr>

        Is the locus of tonight’s storm:<br>  
        One single rose.<br>  
        <br>  
        Its heart squeezed into an uneven oval<br>  
        Petals soft on my thumb<br>  
        Dewdrops glistening on yellow veins<br>  
        Fading and strengthening into a rosy vermillion<br>  
        Then nearly a crusted rouge at the edges<br>  
        <br>  
        The stem having been nearly snapped off in half<br>  
        Perhaps by the splattering dance of the rain<br>  
        Or from hastily dashing through the downpour<br>  
        <br>  
        “It’ll last up to three days without water,” you say when you hand it to me<br>  
        For its vibrance is momentary, fleeting<br>  
        The fantasies it forges dissipating upon touch<br>  
        <br>  
        Faintly I remember retreating to my room<br>  
        Curled bangs drenched<br>  
        The bitter, minty taste of hairspray<br>  
        Still lingering on the tip of my tongue<br>  
        Sinking into the creaky leather chair<br>  
        Piecing together jumbled thoughts<br>  
        <br>  
        It’s different, but different how?<br>  
        <br>  
        My voice falters, a quivering ember<br>
        Words slipping through the sieve of my mind<br>
        As I search for an answer<br><br>
        It’s far from carnal, but not any less cardinal<br>
        Twisting me with a burning desire<br>
        Conjuring images of gazes I dare not hold for any longer<br><br>
        Gingerly I tape it onto my wall<br>
        And it felt comforting knowing that<br>
        Even when all the rain on it had dried<br>
        Even when it had shriveled into a fragile corpse<br>
        A mere shadow of the radiance it once swelled of<br>
        Long after the three days had passed<br>
        I would be still able to see the storm.</div>

        Inconvenient and overconscious,<br>
        I tiredly observe and uncontrollably voice.<br>
        I indulge in undisciplined sensibility,<br>
        and so to you I plead:<br>
        Do not exhaust my keen thinking,<br>
        and spare my bitter heart.<br>
        <br>
        Promise to never send me love letters</div>
