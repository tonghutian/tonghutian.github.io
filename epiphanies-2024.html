          They all sit and smile, the corners of their mouths curving upwards in a most unnatural way.<br>
          Their heads fall back as they laugh their hearts out, their chests vibrating with each laugh.<br>
          I am unique in my sadness and so while my lips form a firm line and my eyes are glossed over with impending tears,<br>
          their eyes are squeezed upwards as their cries of joy escape their lips.<br>
          I look through them as though I am glass, and they continue in their bliss, oblivious to my sorrow.<br>
          I force a smile and try to join them in their joy, but the smile that adorns me is unreal, and I fail.

      <div class="toggle-content" id="how-are-you">Walking on the hallway<br>
        Seeing you<br>
        You say "how are you?"<br>
        I'm confused<br>
        Should I tell you I had to finish an assignment and stayed up too late?<br>
        Should I tell you I didn't sleep well?<br>
        Should I tell you I missed my alarm?<br>
        Should I tell you about the upcoming essay<br>
        The chemistry project<br>
        The religion case study<br>
        Finals?<br>
        The fear before each of them<br>
        not being able to sleep, to relax or how you just can't catch your breath?<br>
        Should I tell you about the news<br>
        I saw this morning<br>
        How many people died<br>
        Due to some autocrat thinking they could do whatever they want to?<br>
        How sorry I feel but can't change anything?<br>
        Should I tell you about friends I miss?<br>
        Should I tell you about all my problems?<br>
        Should I tell you how lost I'm feeling in this universe?<br>
        I just say, "Good.<br>
        How are you?"

      <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleContent('the-world')">The World – Henry Ye ’26</button>
      <div class="toggle-content" id="the-world">
        The world is very round!<br>
It's like a ball—round and sphere.<br>
What comes around,<br>
goes around.<br>
Together we make greatness in this world,<br>
but selfishness takes our hard work away.<br>
The world is beautiful, like a bundle of roses,<br>
but is harsh, like concrete.<br>

The world is small, like a bouncy ball.<br>
Help someone out today,<br>
because always remember,<br>
what you put in is what you get out—<br>
since the world is very round.

      <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleContent('a-bite-of-nostalgia')">A Bite of Nostalgia – Hana He ’27</button>
      <div class="toggle-content" id="a-bite-of-nostalgia">Waking up, I hear soft muffles of conversation while a thin ray of light peek in the cracks of the door.<br>
        The calendar marks February 10th, Korean New Year.<br>
        I rub my eyes while walking out my room only to be jolted awake by a heavenly scent of unami.<br>
        In the kitchen is an amorphous figure of steam that accompanies my mom as she stirs the pot.<br>
        Chop. Chop. Chop. My footsteps sync the rhythm of my mom's knife dancing on the cutting board.<br>
        "Here's your treok-guk!" My mom exclaims.<br>
        I respond, "잘 먹겠습니다!"<br>
        Warm steam hits my face before I see my bowl, and so does a pang of nostalgia.<br>
        Treok-guk is a traditional Korean dish that consists of a beef broth with thinly sliced, oval rice cakes.<br>
        The rice cakes come to life with the garnish of thin, rectangular pieces of seaweed, egg, meat, and zucchini.<br>
        Reminiscing the richness of the broth and chewiness of the rice cakes, I swiftly put a spoonful in my mouth.<br>
        However, instead of delectable notes of unami, a burning sensation strikes my tongue.<br>
        It's too hot! I feel the heat electrocute my taste buds.<br>
        My hands grab my glass of water swiftly, and the cool liquid soothes my throat.<br>
        Meanwhile, my sister had woken up and had started eating her treok-guk.<br>
        We eat in silence for a while, until she asks, "How old did you get?"<br>
        "20, you?" I replied.<br>
        It is said that consuming treok-guk on Korean New Year increases your age;<br>
        my sister and I joke that you gain an age with every rice cake you eat.<br>
        I lift my spoon from my bowl for another bite, but I realize it is my last.<br>
        Every year, I eat this rice cake soup, and this will mark another bowl, another year of my life.<br>
        I swallow carefully.</div>

      <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleContent('an-alluring-world')">An Alluring World – Avery Shorter ’26</button>
      <div class="toggle-content" id="an-alluring-world">What if the world wasn't being held down by humans<br>
        Sprouting from the ground with glistening baby pinks and<br>
        pure whites branching from the roots embedded in the soil<br>
        Green forests encompassed with trees shining with light<br>
        versus being coated with smoke covers<br>
        Glorious animals climbing, walking, and transcending the<br>
        land they no longer are shielded from<br>
        Air flowing freely while whistling its tune<br>
        The greens of Mother Nature stretching to release oxygen<br>
        mid afternoon<br>
        No longer swamped in the hand grasp of pollutions<br>
        looming shadow<br>
        Blue crystal tides not speckled with greens from man's<br>
        synthetics<br>
        Human glories wiping smiles off the majestic creatures<br>
        from the poles white relics<br>
        The shrieking silence of UV light cutting through the<br>
        ozone knight of the atmosphere<br>
        A world slowly crumbling, while being continuously<br>
        clogged with bodies, within the stratosphere<br>
        If only, these possibilities weren't above the glass ceiling of<br>
        humankind.</div>

      <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleContent('chaos-is-a-ladder')">Chaos is a Ladder – Elvis He ’27</button>
      <div class="toggle-content" id="chaos-is-a-ladder">We are afraid of chaos because of the violence, ferocity, evilness,<br>
        Like a bottomless abyss, deep and dark.<br>
        But pure chaos is a ladder rather than a pit.<br>
        The ladder of chaos is random but fair.<br>
        It is a game of risk, an irresistible storm,<br>
        Deadly, orderless, but tempting.<br>
        The game is an offer for the valors, none shall refuse,<br>
        It is the lure of fatal benefits that can't be resisted.<br>
        The beauty of chaos is a thorny rose,<br>
        lying in the uncertainties, waiting to be "throned".<br>
        Oh, look! The cowards refused to climb!<br>
        What a pity! It is the treasure that they shall never find!<br>
        Oh, look! Another one fell from the ladder!<br>
        Unfortunate! The fall breaks the spirit and courage to climb!<br>
        But a champion there shall always be,<br>
        The climb is all there is.</div>

      <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleContent('a-glimpse-of-serenity')">A Glimpse of Serenity – Cindy Han ’27</button>
      <div class="toggle-content" id="a-glimpse-of-serenity">The memory settled in my mind like a tiny yellow stone, from the year before COVID-19, till now. The view outside of the car window flashed by. In a blur, we arrived at a huge cabin in Yellowstone. The sky was so clear that I was almost able to fish the moon from the watery, mirror-like grounds. That night was so peaceful. In the warmth of the campfire, we enjoyed our long-awaited barbecue. Tiny sparks of campfire twinkled and up they went. With a tiny soft strike, it stayed up with thousands of stars. The wind that danced over our faces was refreshing, filling our lungs with the delicious smell of burning wood and food. In the distance, there were no clouds, all we could see was the shining of immensity. My friends and I shared the sense of relaxation and calmness with each other lying on the grass, opening our minds toward the sparkling night sky.<br><br>
        With the rustling leaves and singing birds, the sun peeked over the horizon and climbed up the branches of trees, guiding us through the park. When I was young, my most cherished memory of Yellowstone was buried in the Hot Springs Park, which has always been my favorite, still impressive after all those years. The springs were magnificent, as though surrounded by colorful ribbons, every drop of air was a different color. The world was in a shower of colorful mist. As we walked through the springs with gases surrounding us, the bad smell of sulfur ran into our faces, like rotten eggs. When we were little, we used to call it the "farting spring", beside which we could hardly survive. Under the clear crystal sky, there were the clear bubbling springs and us.</div>

        My focus was switching,<br>
        Like my computer, glitching.<br>
        Dang it, I forgot to pay.<br>
        Once again, my brain was at play.<br>
        Distractions are bewitching.<br>
        What did you say?<br>
        I was writing a poem in my head;<br>
        Hearing, but not listening to your words.<br>
        Writing my own adjectives and verbs.<br>
        I'm sorry, I should probably go back to bed.<br>
        What did you say?</div>

      <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleContent('falling-for-you')">Falling for You is Like Crocheting – July Wen ’25</button>
      <div class="toggle-content" id="falling-for-you">Falling for you is like crocheting<br>
        Stitch after stitch<br>
        Strings of yarn woven through me<br>
        Closing my eyes, pulling my heart<br>
        Tangled up with the way<br>
        It beats or stops<br><br>
        Never knew I could be drawn into something<br>
        So blandly repetitive<br>
        Almost meaningless, if I ignore the soreness in my hands<br>
        But I'm an addict for the overwhelming uncertainty<br>
        —will it end up being<br>
        Given up on, some cut and tied up scraps<br>
        Left in a trash can out the door?<br>
        Will I leave the unfinished<br>
        And someday find it in the deepest corner of my closet<br>
        Covered in dust,<br>
        With the same mistaken edges<br>
        And wrongly tied knots?<br>
        Will its remnants remind me of how it aches?<br>
        Will the way the yarn tangles describe<br>
        those sleepless nights and ideas of you?<br>
        And it's this uncertainty that keeps me going<br>
        Stitch after stitch, weaving in anxiety, passion<br>
        And Hope that escapes and returns<br>
        I keep on working the yarn<br>
        Weaving in words I'll never say to you<br>
        Reaching out to the slightest possibility, asking<br>
        Will it become something<br>
        That could one day keep me warm?</div>

        That I sometimes sail across<br>
        Each time I return,<br>
        I return with a holiday home doesn't celebrate<br>
        Each time I return,<br>
        I return further away from you<br>
        I used to share with you dawns,<br>
        meals, and poems<br>
        Now we barely share one city<br>
        and it's barren cold<br>
        You flip through pretend photo albums of my life<br>
        The same way I roll films containing<br>
        Fragmented frames of yours<br>
        All my Hope dissolved, and<br>
        All my what-ifs buried<br>
        I watch our once woven-together lives slowly detangle,<br>
        And I'll forever hold the urge<br>
        During my countless sleepless midnights<br>
        (when in your world there's daylight)<br>
        To ask you:<br>
        The million times I've crossed time zones<br>
        Have I ever crossed your mind?</div>
