  <div class="toggle-content">
    A small sparrow flutters across the window,<br>
    Its delicate wings spread out against the <br>
    gale. Attempting to flee the horrors of this <br>
    earth, Hard iron barred its path.  <br>
    I watched as it crashed down, down <br>
    And down. <br><br>

    Thump! <br>
    Clang! <br><br>

    A turned head, <br>
    A sigh let out, <br>
    A few footsteps, <br>
    I am back in my room. <br>
    Waiting, waiting, <br>
    And waiting. <br><br>

    The heavens reveled in a fierce battle, <br>
    Spears of electricity lit up the sky, <br>
    Echoed by the drums of thunder, <br>
    And raindrops pounded on my window, <br>
    Mocking the boredom that envelops all in this <br>
    city. Must be fun up there. <br><br>

    My eyes drifted downwards, <br>
    Dark empty streets reflected my gaze. <br>
    Abandoned stalls, <br>
    Locked doors, <br>
    Frail leaves battered down, <br>
    Spiraling until they crash into the <br>
    pavement. Nothing fun down here. <br><br>

    Shanghai, <br>
    Pearl of the Orient, <br>
    A shining star in the east. <br>
    Now, there is nothing, nothing, <br>
    And nothing. <br>
    I turn to the other window, <br>
    A clump of white hazmat suits marched along the <br>
    road, Their footsteps trailed thunder, <br>
    Their heels cracked leaves, <br>
    Their blank masks foretold their business. <br>
    The world stopped for a split <br>
    second, All noise was quelled. <br>
    Breath. <br><br>

    The suits turned to the left, <br>
    And in a flash of white, <br>
    Stormed into a nearby building. <br>
    Exhale… <br><br>

    Several citizens snatched away. <br><br>

    Amidst the downpour, <br>
    Cries of children were silenced, <br>
    Pleas of their parents muted. <br>
    Birds trapped in cages, <br>
    Unable to escape the iron fist of law. And <br>
    the hazmat suits dragged them away. <br><br>

    To where? <br>
    From one birdcage to another. <br>

      <div class="toggle-content">
        <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a work of fiction solely for the purpose of entertainment and by no means represents any version of reality. There is no intended disrespect towards any person or group.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Welcome to Westtown school, class of 202_!</strong><br>
        Here are some guidelines you will need to follow during your time here:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Please keep your student ID card by your side at all times
            <ul>
              <li>If you lose your ID card during the day, report to the technology office. They will help print another ID card for you.</li>
              <li>(For BOARDING STUDENTS ONLY): If you lose your ID card during the night, notify a dorm parent and stay in your dorm for the entire night. Shut the blinds and pull down curtains in your room. The next day, if you see birds circulating around campus, go to the Lake immediately. If you do not see birds flying around, report to the technology office and request another one.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>(For BOARDING STUDENTS ONLY): Do not leave your dorm after checking in. Never leave your lights on after 10:30.</li>
          <li>If a squirrel comes near you, please hold your ID card in your hand and ignore the squirrel. If you are with a friend, discuss your next class loudly.</li>
          <li>If you need to leave the top of campus, for example, to go to the lake, please fill out a form in the upper school office. You will be given a card with a number on it, which you need to return when you get back.</li>
          <li>If you see strange shadows on the ceiling of the library, please ignore them. If you see them more than three times in a week, please report to the upper school office and request to go to the Lake.</li>
          <li>Head to the Health Center if you feel unwell. However, if you are experiencing eye irritation, headache and arm or leg cramps (likely due to overusing electronic devices), head to the Lake (for a walk in nature) after filling out a permission form.</li>
          <li>Advisory is a time to meet with your advisor. Students are required to meet with their advisor at assigned spaces on specific days of the week. During these ten-minute meetings in small groups, you may be asked to talk about your day and discuss recent events or assignments.</li>
          <li>Meeting for Worship is a Quaker tradition that is held weekly at the Meeting House. All students and faculty must attend. It is a 40-minute-long reflective practice and grounds students to the present.
            <ul>
              <li>Meeting for Worship is held outside of the Meeting House once every semester. This "walkout" method ensures freedom of speech and opinion. Ignore the birds if they get too loud.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Never, ever light a fire. An open fire will trigger the smoke detection alarms. When the fire alarm is activated, all students must evacuate to assigned locations. There will be fire drills that are not told to students beforehand. This usually happens on a weekly basis. This is to make sure all students are capable of evacuating in case of an emergency.
            <ul>
              <li>You cannot hear the fire alarm in the restrooms on the first floor of the main building. If you happen to come out of one of these restrooms and hear a fire alarm, please head in and wait for at least 15 minutes before coming out again. If there is no more alarm and no visible damage, resume your normal activities. If you see unfamiliar students in the restroom, hold your ID card in your hand. Do not attempt to interact or talk to them.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Always remember: You are class of 202_. Ignore anyone who tries to tell you otherwise.</li>
          <li>Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in grave consequences. You will also be given infraction points on MyWesttown.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>"You need to learn to follow instructions." —Teacher Marvin</p>
        
        <p>We sincerely hope you have an enjoyable time at Westtown School in the 2022-23 school year.</p>

      <div class="toggle-content">
        <p>You fill the empty air<br>
        like the aroma of cookies baking.<br>
        When the silence is deafening,<br>
        Your melody pervades through the room<br>
        Without crowding it.<br>
        When the halls are a hollow sea shell,<br>
        You are the sound of the ocean.</p>

        <p><em>Content Warning: This story deals with suicidal ideation</em></p>
        
        <p>A sharp breeze cut through my jacket, chilling me to the bone. I sat stoically, watching as the wind picked up piles of dried up leaves, making them shoot up, forcefully moving them to a new place, much like myself. Back at home, I loved the cold, but this was somehow different.</p>
        
        <p>I sat on a ledge, watching the movers struggle to jam my parents' bed frame through the door, the roughness of the concrete ledge cutting into my legs as if they were tacks. Twelve stories down, my father embraced my mother as they watched the last of the furniture enter our building.</p>
        
        <p>I briefly allowed a bird to steal my attention. Its bright red feathers and playful energy distracted me just long enough to allow myself to forget where I was. I imagined myself to be home, the problems and sorrow of today having been shed behind me. I was brought back to the hours my brother and I would spend exploring the woods, each day bringing new adventure and challenges.</p>
        
        <p>As quickly as the diversion had begun, it came to an end. I watched as the bird took off and dissolved into the dull gray sky. Back home, I would've been able to run free alongside the bird. Here, I am confined to the roof of this building, a single tree in a concrete jungle.</p>
        
        <p>I think back to yesterday, I was back home, sitting alone outside. Ever since it happened, I had visited the graveyard often. It had become a serene place where I could be alone with my tears, could barely make out my brother's name on the gravestone before me. I knew that ever leaving his side would be a betrayal to his life, though sitting there, I knew that after that day, I would never be there again.</p>
        
        <p>My heart suddenly became filled with rage. Why did my parents decide to move us to New York? Why exactly one year after it happened? As they explained to me through sobs, they were doing this for all of us, and while they cared, it was time to move on. If my parents cared, they clearly didn't show it.</p>
        
        <p>My anger led me to consider something horrible. With one jump, I could join my brother, an idea that brought goosebumps to my arms and legs. All of my anger, hate, and trauma would suddenly cease. Instead, I sat quietly, reflecting on my journey. I realized that moving forward into a new chapter of life wouldn't be a betrayal to my brother's life, but this would. As much as I missed him, no amount of darkness, anger, and hate would ever fill that hole.</p>
        
        <p>I slid off the ledge and began to run down the stairs to find my parents. I still wasn't ready to move on, but I began to despise this place a little bit less. I went out for a walk, and went to explore the new environment around me. It wasn't the same as when my brother was there, but I felt a sense of excitement and novelty. Ahead of me lay a new world, and I was ready to step into it.</p>
        
        <p>I've returned to the roof pretty frequently. It has transformed itself from a dark place to one where I can be alone and step out of the chaos of life. I enjoy sitting on the ledge, looking out over the city, reflecting on where I've been and where I may be going next.</p>

      <div class="toggle-content">
        <p>The poets compare love to ivies, but mine grows like weed<br>
        You planted seeds that grew into fields of green<br>
        Did you watch the roots bleed into me?<br>
        My love dry, Winter-bitten Autumn leaves<br>
        My love calamitous, clandestine catastrophe<br>
        My love lingers, stares, Burrows under my gaze<br>
        Branches wild and uncontainable, Forever spreading onto<br>
        Your ice frozen, snow fallen ground<br>
        Every word I swallow<br>
        Dissolve in my stomach<br>
        Into acidic longing and insurmountable<br>
        Waves of hurt<br>
        At death I glance when kissing your shadow as the water running in me freezes<br>
        Like tides, I hit your rocks</p>
        
        <p>But every once in a while you give me<br>
        A glimpse of Spring<br>
        Roses and wisteria<br>
        Your cruel kindness change of season<br>
        Can you see me freezing in your Hoax?<br>
        Dandelions growing<br>
        Onto my carcass<br>
        My rotting heart is pounding<br>
        On your edge of March, it's<br>
        Every petal of your littered hope that I treasure<br>
        — and like tides,<br>
        I keep running back</p>

        I gotta write a poem, so I'll improvise.<br>
        My teacher said it's gotta have metaphors and similes,<br>
        But really, that sounds more like spelling bees.</p>
        
        <p>I really don't get the point of this whole thing,<br>
        But I'll give it a shot, and see what I can bring.<br>
        Life is like a carousel, spinning round and round,<br>
        Moments of pure joy, moments we hit the ground.</p>
        
        <p>Like a game of chess, you gotta make your move,<br>
        One mistake could ruin everything, just be smooth.<br>
        The world's a stage, and we're all just actors,<br>
        But it's up to us to be the main character.</p>

      <button class="toggle-btn" id="aunt-cathy">Aunt Cathy – Liam Kazemi</button>
      <div class="toggle-content">
        <p>"A zombie, she looked like a zombie," I thought to myself as my mom helped my Aunt Cathy through the doorway into our house. My Aunt Cathy had been diagnosed with cancer, and her treatments had taken a toll on her body, leaving her pale and gaunt. Her face was sunken in, making it look like she was wearing someone else's skin as a mask. I rarely saw my aunt before she came to our house, so I didn't pay any mind to my mother when she came downstairs into the basement to let me know that my aunt was coming to live with us for a while, and that she'd be staying in the basement. Later that day, it was my dad who came downstairs to the basement. "Put those LEGOs down and come upstairs to say hi to your aunt," my dad told me. I reluctantly put the bricks down and walked upstairs with my dad, not knowing that in just a few hours the basement where I liked to play would turn into a pitch-black underworld that I wouldn't dare step into. As I sat in the living room drinking a glass of mango juice, I couldn't help but think about my LEGOs waiting for me in the basement. I so badly wanted to feel the bricks and let my imagination run rampant, so I knew I had to go down there to retrieve them. With trepidation, I tiptoed down the stairs, my heart beating faster with each step. The basement was darker than I remembered, and I fumbled for the light switch. As I reached for it, I heard a faint sound, like someone whispering. I froze, wondering what it was. Then, out of the darkness, she appeared. My aunt's sunken face loomed in front of me, and I took a step back in fear. It was like staring into the eyes of death itself. "Hello, sweetie," she said, her voice a raspy whisper. I couldn't respond. It felt like my throat had closed up, and I was choking on my own fear. My Aunt Cathy took a step closer, and I stumbled back, falling onto my LEGOs and crushing the house I had just finished building. I scrambled to my feet and ran up the stairs, screaming at the top of my lungs. "Monster! There's a monster in the basement!" My parents rushed to my side, but I was inconsolable. It took them a while to calm me down, and even then, I couldn't shake off the image of my aunt's face that had felt like it had been burned into my memory with an iron. For weeks, I didn't dare go back into the basement, forcing me to read the books my dad had bought for me for Christmas to pass the time. It wasn't until one day while I was playing in the woods that I heard sirens coming from my driveway. I sprinted back up the hill to my house and saw my Aunt Cathy being lifted up on a stretcher into the back of the ambulance. Later that day, we got the news that my aunt had passed away. The whole house was filled with sadness, but for me, it was like a weight had been lifted. I could finally go back to the basement and play with my LEGOs without fear. However, the memory of my aunt's face lingered, like a ghost haunting the corners of my mind. Sitting on the basement carpet a few days after the passing of my aunt, I realized that even I could end up like my aunt someday. What had she done for God to turn her into a zombie monster? I quickly brought my attention back to the zombie apocalypse I had just finished building with my LEGOs and smiled with satisfaction and relief.</p>

      <div class="toggle-content">
        <p>They tell me I'm good at English.<br>
        Do I look like I don't know?<br>
        I learned the same way they did,<br>
        Working tirelessly so I could grow,<br>
        Surrounded by people who look like them too,<br>
        Learning my two to my too to my to.</p>
        
        <p>They tell me it's okay if I stutter<br>
        They understand me, English probably isn't my first language.<br>
        It's like knowing English is my sharp knife's edge,<br>
        Cutting through what they all think<br>
        It's so funny when they're wrong.<br>
        But<br>
        It's only funny the first few times.</p>
        
        <p>They ask me where I'm from<br>
        Where I'm from<br>
        No, where I'm really from.<br>
        My answers don't satisfy them.<br>
        It's like a poorly-made film,<br>
        They have expectations<br>
        But the ending disappoints them.</p>
        
        <p>Their mouths don't tell me what they think of me<br>
        But people say eyes are the gateways to the soul,<br>
        And oh, how their eyes tell their stories:<br>
        "It's because you're Asian,"<br>
        "You were born this way."<br>
        My genetics only go so far.<br>
        It gave me my body, my mind, and my tongue,<br>
        But that's all it gave.<br>
        I shaped everything else.</p>
        
        <p>I love food,<br>
        I love bananas and rice crackers, but coconuts, not so much.<br>
        But sometimes,<br>
        this isn't about food.<br>
        People like to be rude.<br>
        It messes with me.<br>
        Just let me be.</p>
        
        <p>"나만 다른게 싫어,"<br>
        I'm the only different one, I hate it.<br>
        "내 몸, 내 음식, 내 마음, 내 냄새, 내 피부, 내 머리카락, 모든 것,"<br>
        My body, my food, my mind, my smell, my skin, my hair, everything.<br>
        They point it out every day,<br>
        But there's no need, I see it too,<br>
        This is something in which I had no say<br>
        So just let me blend in for once.<br>
        Let me be the same.<br>
        After all, we're all humans, right?</p>
        
        <p>Here's the problem,<br>
        Even when I find people<br>
        With the same tongue as me,<br>
        I'm still different,<br>
        Life just can't let me be.</p>
        
        <p>I'm stuck in the middle.<br>
        Having both is a curse,<br>
        It hurts me, more than just a little<br>
        Too American for Asia,<br>
        Too Asian for America,<br>
        I guess I'll never fit in.</p>
        
        <p>There's a chance I would've never known.<br>
        My wings would've never flown,<br>
        And I would've lived on without knowing how.<br>
        But my eyes are open now,<br>
        I see things anew.<br>
        I see you.</p>
        
        <p>I don't just hear what you have to say.<br>
        I see your words,<br>
        I see what you hide under them.<br>
        Even if you didn't mean to hide them,<br>
        I see them better than you do.</p>
        
        <p>"You have it so easy!"<br>
        At least you have your family with you,<br>
        At least you have people who look like you,<br>
        eat like you,<br>
        Talk like you,<br>
        At least you had it.<br>
        Don't tell me I have it easy if you did.</p>
        
        <p>Do you have parents that started a new life in the middle of nowhere?<br>
        How often do you talk to your extended family in person? How often can you?<br>
        Do people ask you if you're related to strangers?<br>
        Do people speak slowly to you, assuming you won't understand?<br>
        Do people mock you without trying, hitting your weakest spots, your identity?</p>
        
        <p>If you hear me,<br>
        And you get me,<br>
        I'm sorry.<br>
        I know.<br>
        I know how hard it is,<br>
        I know how tiring it is,<br>
        I know how lonely it is,<br>
        But if you can't take my words as your own,<br>
        Don't say shit to me about them.</p>
        
        <p>This is my language, not yours.<br>
        No matter how much you study it, it's still mine.<br>
        This is the one part of me I will never let you control.<br>
        I let you control my food, my clothes, my culture, my closet,<br>
        But I will never let you control my tongue</p>

        crutch or kindling<br>
        nurture inklings<br>
        to ignite or to salve<br>
        to inflict, to resolve<br>
        these building blocks are plentiful, essential<br>
        raft, vessel, raw material potential<br>
        but desert shores are empty of blueprints</p>
        
        <p><strong>shiver, wince</strong><br>
        as swimmers rinse<br>
        inhibitions away<br>
        baptized by the spray<br>
        never plunging under water,<br>
        I hover, wonder longer<br>
        how others strike such bold strokes in their sleep<br>
        while shame would drown me the ankle-deep<br>
        anchored by this instinctive abstinence</p>
        
        <p><strong>limitless</strong><br>
        innocence<br>
        they steer their ships<br>
        and chart their trips<br>
        I slowly build a model<br>
        construct details in a bottle<br>
        pleas to be rescued, never to be found<br>
        more grave than treasure buried underground<br>
        let sands of time obscure the evidence</p>
        
        <p><strong>phantom kiss</strong><br>
        scant, sunless<br>
        fading gazes<br>
        scathing grazes<br>
        brush and burn, then melt and mangle<br>
        fantasize, fray, spiral, tangle<br>
        clutch moments in my palm, each stolen token<br>
        careless encounters, brief words barely spoken<br>
        gilded by dreams, lenses with brighter tints</p>
        
        <p><strong>fingertips</strong><br>
        wistfulness<br>
        sharp, jagged, thin<br>
        sliced up my skin<br>
        but I chose to caress it<br>
        press it, trace your edges<br>
        tinged with blood, now sealed like lips, like lockets<br>
        incrimination hidden in my pockets<br>
        its scars haunted the surface ever since</p>

      <div class="toggle-content">
        <p>The potent smell of sunscreen filled the nose of the middle-aged man. He was clutching onto the small patches of hair around the side of his scalp and his six-year-old son by the arm. As his son played in the water around him, he gazed at the mass of people surrounding him. He noticed those who were just like him, clinging to their children and their marriages as if their lives depended on it. Many of them were dragged out of their homes, out to the long strip of the oceanside city to try and wring out what was left out of a dry relationship. Except after hours in the baking heat, there'd likely be an altercation right before the end of the family vacation and a silent car ride on the way back. Although it had yet to happen this time, he felt it was inevitable.</p>
        
        <p>A small voice tried to say something to him, but he didn't care very much nor could he make out what it was saying. The man was too busy scouting the waves around him. The waves of people who wished they didn't peak in college. The waves of people who wished they waited a bit longer to give their parents grandchildren. The waves of people who couldn't rid their beer gut even after taking every possible measure. The waves of people who couldn't satisfy their wives no matter how persistent their efforts were. He saw his reflection in the waves. The man looked up to the sky and the noise of the waves crashing together faded into the sound of families around him attempting their best impressions of mid-afternoon fun.</p>
        
        <p>The sun flashed into the man's eyes and he saw a flash of the man he once was. A fearless man who was never afraid to explore unfamiliar locations with his friends. A man who was always the life of the party and would never be too timid around women. A man who was the best at every sport he played and the man who would never get shown up. The man was being tugged on by reality. Not that he cared, he was the one who would never back down from any challenge or "triple-dog dare" that crossed his path. He was the man that totaled his car after he drank half a bottle of bourbon on a Friday evening. He was the man who didn't back down from the cliff over a waterfall and he was the man that made a moronic decision he never fully recovered from.</p>
        
        <p>Reality tugged a bit harder, but he was a man surrounded by a sea of regret. He was the man who had his kid beside him one second and didn't the next. He was the man who broke into a cold sweat and started to panic. He was the man who called out for his kid frantically and almost started to break down. He was the man who would never be able to go back to his wife if he lost their "pride and joy" that ruined their marriage. He was the man who called out some more in a desperate attempt to find his kid in the barren sea of shame that surrounded him. Reality tugged as hard as it could and finally the man found himself back on that Ocean City beach, with his child right beside him. The child wanted to jump waves with his father, as he looked down, smiled, and agreed. They ventured deeper into the waves surrounding them.</p>

        <p>O my T-800:<br>
        How many times have I sat staring at my paper,<br>
        And wondered what I would do<br>
        With you<br>
        my third arm<br>
        my primitive tail if I ever had one.<br>
        your silver, metallic tip, the precision it gives<br>
        the sharpness, enough to penetrate my heart the first time I saw you.</p>
        
        <p>What has your tip seen?<br>
        Chemical compound formulas, Conic sections;<br>
        Integration and differentiation;<br>
        My essay I pump out before English class ends.<br>
        Your touch, always so silky</p>
        
        <p>S</p>
        <p>M</p>
        <p>O</p>

        <p>H</p>
        
        <p>If I was an A4 paper, I would have begged to be caressed by you<br>
        Yes, you have been thrown into the pond (by me!)<br>
        The mud<br>
        And the hard concrete on a summer day<br>
        But that doesn't change that I love you so.<br>
        One day I'll take you to the top of the Himalayas,<br>
        To the bottom of the Mariana Trench<br>
        To outer space, to where no human (or T-800)<br>
        Have been before</p>
        
        <p>But before that,<br>
        You sit in my pencil case<br>
        Before I forget to put you back<br>
        In my bag<br>
        at the end of class.</p>
